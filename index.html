				Smartwatch is a wristband-mounted device. Like smartphones they have a touchscreen, apps and most of them have a heart rate sensor, can measure the oxygen level and indicate stress levels. The main reasons they are here is because you can not put all of it on a smartphone. Because it can measure these things, they are perfect for training, some watches can even measure your body composition. They can also keep you more concentrated on your training by not showing all of the apps you have on your phone.

				Airpods are sticks that play music. Unlike smartphones speakers you are the only one that can hear the music that you are currently playing. Some of them have smart features like ear detection or noise cancelation. Ear detection prevents the music from playing when you take one or two of the airpods out of your ear. The noise cancelation prevents other noise from getting in your ear. So you only hear the music that you are playing and not the music of the gym.

				Bike computers are devices that you can put on your bike.it has 3 parts, 2 parts to see how fast you are going and the computer itself, one part goes on your wheel, the other part goes on next to the wheel so see how fast you are cycling. And the computer goes on the steer. On the computer you can see how fast you are going, the fastest you went and your average speed. Although you can see all of this on a smartwatch, the smartwatch uses GPS which can make it inaccurate.
