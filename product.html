				Global story about the product
			</h1>
			<p>
				In the early stages some phones would have a heart rate sensor, but they took it off the smart phones because it became to expensive and almost nobody cared about these features. So, the smartwatch is here to fix that problem, by putting the sensor that they took from the phones and putting them on a watch they created more revenue and put other sensor that where not on the phone now on a watch. For this we are going to look at the Samsung galaxy watch 5.

				What product does this innovation solve
			</h1>
			<p>
				When you are training it can be hard to monitor all your accomplishments, the smart watch can solve this problem. It can track your heart rate, oxygen levels, indicate stress. This version can track your body temperature and can indicate if you have a flue. It can also improve your sleep by tracking how you are sleeping (the sleeping stages). With all this information can improve your performance while training and you can adjust your training schedule.

				How to use this innovation
			</h1>
			<p>
				If you want to use it you just must put it on your wrist, granted you are the owner of the watch you know the password, if you take the watch off it automatically locks itself. You can change the settings on how often the watch measures things like your heart rate. You can also manually start a measurement by going to the tile that you want to measure and press measure. All this only works if the battery is not empty, a full charge last 1-2 days and takes 30 minutes to charge.

			<h1>
				Who is using this innovation
			</h1>
			<p>
				The smartwatch is primarily designed to be used by young people. Young people know how to use smartphones and there for are more likely to buy a smartwatch however, older people at the age of around 50 can also use them with ease though they might not see them the same way youngsters do. For people older than 50 I would personally not recommend it because it can be a bit confusing how to use.

			<h1>
				What can you expect from the service this company is delivering
			</h1>
			<p>
				The watch is product that doesnâ€™t require to be maintain. However, Samsung does have some services that you can use with the watch. If you want to see how you are sleeping and improve it, you have to fill out a short survey and the phone will adjust a plan to improve your sleep. If you follow the plan, you should in theory sleep better and there for, feel better. Whether or not this work is up to questioning.

			<h1>
				Future from this innovation
			</h1>
			<p>
				In the past the battery of the smartwatch has not been exactly optimal, battery life lasting 1-2 days and 1 day if you are using the watch intensely. Using the GPS tracker, setting the heart rate scanner and blood oxygen scanner to always measure, putting on Wi-Fi and brightness of max are some of the reasons why it will only last a day with intense use. I hope that in the future the battery life will be improved to last at least 1 or 2 days more.
